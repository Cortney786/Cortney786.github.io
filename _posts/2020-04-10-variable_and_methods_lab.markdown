Variables hold any data that can be used in any program.

We want to find the number and name of students per teacher class setting.




teacher Students

no_of_students = 0                                       (variables begin with lowercase letter or _ on this line)

def initialize (name)                                        (define what your are looking for on this line which is the students name)

stud_name = name                                         (then call the method on this line)

end                                                                        (your variables will exist until you have typed end.)

                                                                            
def toatl_no_of_students( )                         (now we are defining how many students we have on ths line)

no_of_students += 1                                      (here we are calculating the number of students)

puts "Total number of students: no_of_students"            (on this line it will print out what you asked your method to do
                                                                                                              make sure that you use " " marks to indicate what you want to                                                                                                                     print)
