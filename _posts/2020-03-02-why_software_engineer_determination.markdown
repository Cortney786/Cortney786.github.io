When I was in the 4th grade back in "89", I was one of the few kids that had the opportunity to bring a brand-new Macintosh desktop home for the summer, because of my academic skills. That summer I completed the fun learning program that was required of me to do. Back then I always wondered how did this intriguing machine work. I was devastated when we had to return it, because we didn’t have a computer at home.

Fast forward to high school, my Junior year. The computer technician would come to our school to my computer lab due to, there consistent problems with our computers. I would always ask him a tone of questions. This is when I knew wanted to be a Computer Data Entry specialist.  I thought this would be my way of learning how to input information in a computer which gave it my demands. Life happened and my goals of going to college after High school was short lived. 

7 years later, I thought me doing anything with computers at that time was impossible. Non traditional colleges didn’t   offer Computer IT. So, I went to a school for Criminal Justice, I wanted to learn forensics. That was short lived due to the school I went to lost its accreditation. Working for a property management company back in 2011. I met a resident that was a computer forensic specialist. He told me if you really like computers and you don’t know if you would be able to stand a crime scene. They have computer forensics. Not knowing what exactly what it consists of. He told be basically that although we think when we are erasing data off a computer that it is truly deleted it is not. This how criminals think they have gotten away from any crimes that they comminted. Digital information never go away. This was very intriguing to me, because I thought I would finally learn how to communicate and dissect computers.

2014 I was not accepted at Southern Polytechnic University and I ended up going to the University of Phoenix. I was told if I took Computer Security that it will lead me to Software Engineering. I received my Associates and within in the 2 years and I didn’t learning anything about coding. So, I started dipping and dabbing in the field and learned more from outside programs then from school. Frustrated and outraged I was not giving up. I really wanted to learn. No company would give me the opportunity to come right in and not have anything under my belt computer IT wise or certifications. After graduation it became harder each year that passed. I continued to try and figure out how can I get to the next point that would lead me to my dream job. Starting as a Software engineer, to one day being a Computer Forensic Specialist.
